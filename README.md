## Philip S. Cowperthwaite's PhD Thesis

This is a repo to store and track the writing of my thesis. It is setup to typeset into the Harvard thesis format using a template provided by Courtney Dressing (@AstroDressing).

In General! Figure out how to rotate tables.
1. Introduction - Write it.
2. Chapter 2 - Update to better reflect published version.
3. Chapter 3 - Needs second pass at references/cross-links. Bulk formatting.
4. Chapter 4 - Needs second pass at references/cross-links. Bulk formatting.
5. Chapter 5 - Needs second pass at references/cross-links. Bulk formatting.
6. Chapter 6 - Future Directions. Write it. (Maybe)
